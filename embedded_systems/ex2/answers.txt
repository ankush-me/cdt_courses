(1) Edit-Compile-Link-Execute
==============================

Task 1
------
The following goal (in order) were executed:
  callbacks.c
  data-structures.c
  exercise.c
  function-pointers.c
  illegal-memory.c
  malloc-free.c
  read-write.c
  ex-02

Task 2
------
The `clean' goal removes (rm) all .o files in the build directory and all files with names starting with 'ex2'


(2) Pointer Arithmetic
======================

Task 1
------
data[i] is equivalent to *(data+i)

Task 2
------
[Done] : See read-write.c



(3) Stack and Heap
==================

Task 1, 2 : Done in malloc-free.c


(4) Illegal Memory
==================
Task 1 : Done in illegal-memory.c
Task 2 : No operation is performed if null is passed to free. Hence, a good practice would be
to initialize all pointers to null so that if they are accidently free'd nothing bad would happen.
