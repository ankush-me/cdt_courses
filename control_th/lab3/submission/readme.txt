Control Theory
==============

Submission by : Ankush Gupta

The four labs' assesment questions are answered in the matlab scripts.
The matlab scripts are interactive : i.e. they run the code question-by-question,
waiting for a key-press b/w each question.

Following are the files that answer the questions:

partA.m            : for the lab session on Monday
partB.m            : for the lab session on Tuesday
partC_LMI.m        : LMI based control theory lab session on Thursday
partD_ellipsoid.m  : SDP for circumscribing a set of ellipsoids (Friday)
partD_MultiObj.m   : multi-objective controller design using SDP (Friday)

Please run the code on Mac/Linux for correct terminal output formatting.

Please email me at ankush@robots.ox.ac.uk if there's any difficulty in
running the code.

Thank you!
